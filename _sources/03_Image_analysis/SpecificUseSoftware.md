[Cellpose](https://www.cellpose.org/) {cite}`Stringer2021-uq` is a {term}`segmentation` algorithm, it provides a graphical user interface that allows users to use trained models or train their own using their images and annotations.


```{dropdown} What type of image analysis problem is it best at?

Object {term}`segmentation`, most trained models are for cell {term}`segmentation` but could be applied to segment other similar objects 
```

```{dropdown} What are its disadvantages?



* Its use requires some computational knowledge. 
* Training a new model requires manual annotation correction that can be time consuming, but is likely less time consuming than other methods of training models.

[ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/) {cite}`Berg2019-no` is a tool for interactive image classification, {term}`segmentation` and analysis. It leverages machine-learning algorithms to perform pixel and object-level classification. Using it requires no experience in {term}`image processing`.


```{dropdown} What type of image analysis problem is it best at?

It can be used for both instance {term}`segmentation` and semantic {term}`segmentation`. It does also perform {term}`segmentation` and tracking, though with somewhat fewer tunable parameters than some other tools offer. 
```

```{dropdown} What are its disadvantages?



* Sometimes loading or exporting images can require a bit of troubleshooting to get the dimensions correct.
* ilastik is limited by your computer‚Äôs RAM so training a model with lots of features or working with very large images is likely to slow you down.
```

[Piximi](https://www.piximi.app/) is an application for annotation and classification that runs entirely from your browser and requires no installation and minimal setup. 


```{dropdown} What type of image analysis problem is it best at?

Piximi can do image classification using machine learning 
```

```{dropdown} What are its disadvantages?



* It is still in the developing phases and some of its proposed features are not available yet

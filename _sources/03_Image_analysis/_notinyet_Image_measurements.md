## Colocalization

```{dropdown} What is a colocalization coefficient?
The colocalization coefficient is a measurement to quantify the degree of overlap
between two channels in a microscopy image. It is a widely used measurement in
biology to indicate interaction of the molecules being measured. There are different
types of methods that can be used to obtain this measurement.

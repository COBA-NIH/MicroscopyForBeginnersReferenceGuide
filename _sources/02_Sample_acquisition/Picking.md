# Choosing the right microscopy modality

## Introduction
(content/microscope_selection)=
Choosing the right microscope for your experiment will be a factor both of what the experiment dictates and what the researcher can access. The image below (from [Fundamentals of Microscopy by Jermey Sanderson](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cpmo.76) {cite}`Sanderson2020-qz`) gives a sense of the sorts of decisions one should consider when choosing a microscope; a more thorough description of the pros and cons of various kinds of microscopes can be found in [this tutorial](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0313-9){cite}`Jonkman2020-bo`.

## Opportunities for microscopy resource access

While some imaging facilities are open only to members of a single institution, others allow outside visitors or even sponsor visitors to travel to them. 

* **Advanced Imaging Center - Janelia Research Campus.** The AIC was created to give access to the broad scientific community to new imaging instruments that are not commercially available. Proposals can be submitted during open calls at [their website](https://www.aicjanelia.org/apply).

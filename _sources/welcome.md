# Welcome

Welcome to the world of bioimaging and bioimage analysis! This book is a companion website to our review "TITLE AND LINK." Our goal is to provide recommendations and a live repository of resources for beginner biologists looking to understand the factors that impact their fluorescence microscopy experiments. The chapters in this book cover sample preparation, image acquisition, image analysis, and data interpretation.

For each section, we also present a curated list of resources that are good starting places for beginners to learn more. We use icons to indicate the type of resource:

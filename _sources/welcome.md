## What is this book?

This book is a companion website to our review "TITLE AND LINK." Our goal is to provide recommendations and a curated set of resources for biologists looking to understand the factors that impact their fluorescence microscopy experiments.

This book is a collaborative effort from experts in biology, imaging, image analysis, and data management, interpretation, and presentation. Our tips and recommendations come from real experiences training and working with biologists who are beginners to bioimaging and bioimage analysis. When starting out in a new field, you often don't know what you don't know. Here we provide context, tips for avoiding common beginner errors, and a focused list of high-quality, open source resources (full list available [HERE LINK]). We use icons to indicate the type of resource:

## What **isn't** this book?

* This book is **not** meant to be an exhaustive list of all resources. Those exist (see [here](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1873-3468.14451) and [here](https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org/training-education-resources/)). Our goal is for a more streamlined, beginner-accessible guide.
* This book is **not** a protocol or step by step guide, though certain resources we link to might be. Each subsection from sample prep to data interpretation are massive topics that we can't exhaustively cover in a guide for beginners.


## How to use this book:

## What if my resource/topic is not included?
Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/broadinstitute/MicroscopyForBeginnersReferenceGuide/issues) or pull request to contribute! We hope for this to be a living document reflecting the best practices and resources available.

The key to successful immunofluorescence labeling is to validate the antibody and to use the appropriate controls. Do not assume that antibodies have been validated to ensure specificity to the target protein. Additionally, secondary antibodies can bind nonspecifically to different cellular structures. It is important to take the time to validate each antibody, as the issues with antibody integrity are well known [11].  Appropriate blocking during immunofluorescence labeling will reduce nonspecific binding, but non-optimal blocking conditions can increase background, so testing the effect of blocking as well as secondary-only controls are important during the optimization process. Isotype controls are also highly recommended, and when possible, knockdown and knockout controls are the gold standard for testing the specificity of the primary antibody.

Immuno-labeling is one of the most common labeling techniques for fixed samples. You can use fluorescently conjugated primary antibodies to detect the protein of interest or a two-step labeling with a primary antibody and a fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody. Primary-secondary labeling tends to result in signal amplification. The main issue with immunolabeling is the size of the antibodies, which require extensive permeabilization. Another good option is to use nano-bodies, which only have the heavy-chain and are significantly smaller than regular antibodies.

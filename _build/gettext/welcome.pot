msgid "This book is a collaborative effort from experts in biology, imaging, image analysis, and data management, interpretation, and presentation. Our tips and recommendations come from real experiences training and working with biologists who are beginners to bioimaging and bioimage analysis. When starting out in a new field, you often don't know what you don't know. Here we provide context, tips for avoiding common beginner errors, and a focused list of high-quality, open source resources (full list available [here](bibliography)). We use icons to indicate the type of resource:"

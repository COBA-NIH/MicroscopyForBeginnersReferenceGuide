msgid "What do we mean by quantitative bioimaging?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../QuantitativeBioimaging.md:5
msgid "While microscopy was by necessity a qualitative science for most of its history, we now live in an era where microscope images can be used to precisely quantify observable phenotypes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../QuantitativeBioimaging.md:7
msgid "The ability to draw accurate quantitative answers from these experiments relies on certain best practices being followed. If one can confidently say \"Yes\" to each of the following 4 questions, one is likely to be able to quantify their sample."
msgstr ""

#: ../../QuantitativeBioimaging.md:9
msgid "Have I prepared my sample in a way that minimizes technical artifacts and lets me understand exactly which molecule(s) I am observing?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../QuantitativeBioimaging.md:10
msgid "Have I conducted my microscopy so that I minimize technical artifacts and am in the quantitative range of the detector attached to my microscope?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../QuantitativeBioimaging.md:11
msgid "Have I selected analysis metric(s) that truly answer my biological question and measured them in a way that minimizes technical artifacts?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../QuantitativeBioimaging.md:12
msgid "Have I chosen appropriate statistical comparisons and data presentation approaches so that the distribution of my metric(s) can be fairly compared across samples, answering my biolgical question?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../QuantitativeBioimaging.md:14
msgid "Answering each of these questions requires thought, expertise, and often a fair amount of trial and error; it can feel overwhelming to grapple with all the technical aspects and caveats present in a bioimaging experiment. These questions **_can_** be answered, however, though often not in a single pass - [continuous optimization through multiple rounds of answering these questions](qb-decision-cycle) is typically needed for best results."

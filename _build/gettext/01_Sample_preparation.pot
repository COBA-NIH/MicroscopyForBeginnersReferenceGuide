msgid "There are many different options for types of samples to image, and advances in sample preparation techniques and imaging modalities are continually enabling the imaging of more diverse and complex biological specimens. As with many other aspects of experimental design, sample type selection comes with tradeoffs. Samples that are amenable to simple preparation and imaging tend to be small, thin, and relatively clear, like a monolayer of cultured cells. Such samples have obvious advantages and can be imaged in a high-throughput manner, but they're not suitable for every biological question. Sometimes a thicker specimen, like an organoid, or whole or sectioned tissue is needed, especially when the biological question involves interactions between different types of cells. Carefully consider what biological context is appropriate for your question and what measurements you'd ultimately like to be able to make. Below, we summarize some common sample types"

msgid "Most applications in microscopy require imaging through a glass coverslip of a specific thickness and tolerance. However, many cell types do not survive or cannot grow on glass and require additional coatings and manipulations of the coverslip to ensure the health of the sample. As an alternative some companies manufacture imaging chambers (multi well plates, 35 mm dishes‚Ä¶) with proprietary polymers that have similar properties to glass (optical polymers), thus enabling high resolution imaging. It is imperative to understand whether the immersion oil used during imaging affects the integrity of these polymers, as the solvents in some immersion media can crack or dissolve the polymer layer."

msgid "**Photobleaching and phototoxicity** - Photobleaching can be defined as the irreversible destruction of a fluorophore in its excited state, meaning, that fluorophore will not be able to emit more light and the fluorescence signal will therefore degrade over time, affecting signal to noise ratio and intensity measurements. In order to minimize photobleaching during acquisition, there are a number of photobleaching reagent agents that can be added to the media. These agents minimize photobleaching of fluorophores to a different extent, and therefore it is important to contact the manufacturer to ensure they are optimal for the specific fluorophore. For example addition of oxygen scavengers to the imaging media such as glucose oxidase or pyranose 2-oxidase can significantly reduce photobleaching. It is important to understand that the use of {term}`oxygen scavengers` may affect live cell imaging, as these scavengers can affect the ATP and oxygen levels within the sample, compromising its health and therefore biological function."

msgid "**Cells are dying** - Fluorescent light induces DNA damage and oxidation of cellular components (phototoxicity). In addition, fluorophore photobleaching can further induce phototoxicity by creating reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of antioxidants and removal of certain molecules (e.g., riboflavin) from the imaging media can reduce the ROS produced during imaging, improving the health of the sample.{cite}`Stockley2017`"

msgid "**My sample is too opaque** - Thicker specimens, like thick tissue sections, pigmented cells, or whole organisms can be challenging to image due to light absorption and scattering induced by the inhomogeneities in {term}`refractive index` within the tissue itself, resulting in poor light penetration. To facilitate imaging of tissues, researchers often cut thick tissues into slices of different thicknesses. This process is called tissue sectioning. In most cases the samples are fixed and embedded in paraffin or frozen in tissue freezing medium and later cut into thin slices by a machine like a cryostat, microtome, or vibratome and sections collected into a tube or onto a slide. Alternatively, most components in any complex biological system such as an organ are not contained within this two-dimensional volume, and therefore, this approach compromises the understanding of the spatial relationships among cellular components. Tissue clearing focused on reducing the inhomogeneities in the tissue by equilibrating the {term}`refractive index` throughout the sample. This allows light to pass through the tissue and therefore enables high resolution, volumetric imaging of whole organs and tissues using conventional microscopy techniques such as confocal microscopy without the need to physically section the sample."

While there is a wide range of coverslip sizes and shapes, the most important attribute is the coverslip thickness. Coverslip grade dictates the expected thickness and tolerance. These factors are important because most microscope manufacturers assume a specific coverslip thickness (0.17mm) in the design of objective lenses to minimize aberrations. These aberrations tend to affect the brightness and axial resolution, reducing signal to noise ratio, sharpness, and resolution. The tolerance of the coverslip (to minimize the variability in thickness) is essential for super-resolution techniques or intensity measurements in images collected with high numerical aperture objectives. Other applications do not require the mounting of samples onto glass or plastic but instead have the sample and the objective lens immersed in the same medium."

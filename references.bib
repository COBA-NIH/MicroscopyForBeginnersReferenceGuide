              estimates obtained by cross-validation",
  author   = "Soneson, Charlotte and Gerster, Sarah and Delorenzi, Mauro",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: With the large amount of biological data that is
              currently publicly available, many investigators combine multiple
              data sets to increase the sample size and potentially also the
              power of their analyses. However, technical differences (``batch
              effects'') as well as differences in sample composition between
              the data sets may significantly affect the ability to draw
              generalizable conclusions from such studies. FOCUS: The current
              study focuses on the construction of classifiers, and the use of
              cross-validation to estimate their performance. In particular, we
              investigate the impact of batch effects and differences in sample
              composition between batches on the accuracy of the classification
              performance estimate obtained via cross-validation. The focus on
              estimation bias is a main difference compared to previous
              studies, which have mostly focused on the predictive performance
              and how it relates to the presence of batch effects. DATA: We
              work on simulated data sets. To have realistic intensity
              distributions, we use real gene expression data as the basis for
              our simulation. Random samples from this expression matrix are
              selected and assigned to group 1 (e.g., 'control') or group 2
              (e.g., 'treated'). We introduce batch effects and select some
              features to be differentially expressed between the two groups.
              We consider several scenarios for our study, most importantly
              different levels of confounding between groups and batch effects.
              METHODS: We focus on well-known classifiers: logistic regression,
              Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and
              Random Forests (RF). Feature selection is performed with the
              Wilcoxon test or the lasso. Parameter tuning and feature
              selection, as well as the estimation of the prediction
              performance of each classifier, is performed within a nested
              cross-validation scheme. The estimated classification performance
              is then compared to what is obtained when applying the classifier
              to independent data.",

              to cellular macromolecules upon excitation light illumination can
              impair sample physiology, and even lead to sample death. In this
              review, we explain how phototoxicity influences live samples, and
              we highlight that, besides the obvious effects of phototoxicity,
              there are often subtler consequences of illumination that are
              imperceptible when only the morphology of samples is examined.
              Such less apparent manifestations of phototoxicity are equally
              problematic, and can change the conclusions drawn from an
              experiment. Thus, limiting phototoxicity is a prerequisite for
              obtaining reproducible quantitative data on biological processes.
              We present strategies to reduce phototoxicity, e.g. limiting the
              illumination to the focal plane and suggest controls for
              phototoxicity effects. Overall, we argue that phototoxicity needs

              based on immunolocalization analysis involving paraformaldehyde
              fixation. Paraformaldehyde fixation has been widely adapted to
              preserved cell morphology before immunofluorescence staining. On
              one hand, the processed cells are no longer living. On the other
              hand, the processing may lead to misinterpretation of
              localization. HMGBs from Arabidopsis were fused with enhanced
              green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and transformed into tobacco
              BY-2 cells. Basically, the localization of these HMGB proteins
              detected with EGFP fluorescence in interphase agreed with
              previous publications. Upon 4\% paraformaldehyde fixation,
              AtHMGB1 was found associated with interphase but not the
              metaphase chromosomes as previously reported. However, when EGFP
              fluorescence signal was directly observed under confocal
              microscope without fixation, association of AtHMGB1 with
              metaphase chromosomes can be detected. Paraformaldehyde fixation
              led to dissociation of EGFP tagged AtHMBG1 protein from metaphase
              chromosomes. This kind of pre-processing of live specimen may
              lead to dissociation of protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid
              interaction. Therefore, using of EGFP fusion proteins in live

               critically evaluating studies carried out by others.
               Unfortunately, many researchers who are otherwise rigorous and
               thoughtful in their scientific approach lack sufficient
               knowledge of this field. This methods chapter is written with
               such individuals in mind. Although the majority of examples are
               drawn from the field of Caenorhabditis elegans biology, the
               concepts and practical applications are also relevant to those
               who work in the disciplines of molecular genetics and cell and
               developmental biology. Our intent has been to limit theoretical
               considerations to a necessary minimum and to use common examples
               as illustrations for statistical analysis. Our chapter includes
               a description of basic terms and central concepts and also
               contains in-depth discussions on the analysis of means,
               proportions, ratios, probabilities, and correlations. We also
               address issues related to sample size, normality, outliers, and
               non-parametric approaches.",

  abstract = "Widefield fluorescence microscopy is seeing dramatic improvements
              in resolution, reaching today 100 nm in all three dimensions.
              This gain in resolution is achieved by dispensing with uniform
              K{\"o}hler illumination. Instead, non-uniform excitation light
              patterns with sinusoidal intensity variations in one, two, or
              three dimensions are applied combined with powerful image
              reconstruction techniques. Taking advantage of non-linear
              fluorophore response to the excitation field, the resolution can
              be further improved down to several 10 nm. In this review
              article, we describe the image formation in the microscope and
              computational reconstruction of the high-resolution dataset when
              exciting the specimen with a harmonic light pattern conveniently
              generated by interfering laser beams forming standing waves. We

              numerous biological techniques as it is thought to preserve a
              snapshot of biomolecular transactions in living cells. Fixed-cell
              imaging techniques such as immunofluorescence have been widely
              used to detect liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vivo.
              Here, we compared images, before and after fixation, of cells
              expressing intrinsically disordered proteins that are able to
              undergo LLPS. Surprisingly, we found that PFA fixation can both
              enhance and diminish putative LLPS behaviors. For specific
              proteins, fixation can even cause their droplet-like puncta to
              artificially appear in cells that do not have any detectable
              puncta in the live condition. Fixing cells in the presence of
              glycine, a molecule that modulates fixation rates, can reverse
              the fixation effect from enhancing to diminishing LLPS
              appearance. We further established a kinetic model of fixation in
              the context of dynamic protein-protein interactions. Simulations
              based on the model suggest that protein localization in fixed
              cells depends on an intricate balance of protein-protein
              interaction dynamics, the overall rate of fixation, and notably,
              the difference between fixation rates of different proteins.
              Consistent with simulations, live-cell single-molecule imaging
              experiments showed that a fast overall rate of fixation relative
              to protein-protein interaction dynamics can minimize fixation
              artifacts. Our work reveals that PFA fixation changes the
              appearance of LLPS from living cells, presents a caveat in
              studying LLPS using fixation-based methods, and suggests a
              mechanism underlying the fixation artifact.",

              maximise the biological information extracted from them, a sound
              information system is required. Ease of integration with data
              analysis pipelines and other computational tools is a key
              requirement for it. RESULTS: We have developed openBIS, an open
              source software framework for constructing user-friendly,
              scalable and powerful information systems for data and metadata
              acquired in biological experiments. openBIS enables users to
              collect, integrate, share, publish data and to connect to data

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used
              in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use,
              recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture,
              ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur
              programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a
              diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that
              spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly
              growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical
              limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software
              engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to
              ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of
              modern science. RESULTS: We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase,
              engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate
              extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more
              powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community
              while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This
              next-generation ImageJ, called ``ImageJ2'' in places where the
              distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It
              separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user
              interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications
              to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework
              allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to
              visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned
              data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets,
              which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition.
              Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is
              maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly
              integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and
              developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace.
              CONCLUSIONS: Scientific imaging benefits from open-source
              programs that advance new method development and deployment to a
              diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea
              in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have
              posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The
              described improvements provide a framework engineered for
              flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as
              accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on
              implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding
              collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.",

  abstract = "One of the most fundamental concepts of microscopy is that of
              resolution-the ability to clearly distinguish two objects as
              separate. Recent advances such as structured illumination
              microscopy (SIM) and point localization techniques including
              photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM), and stochastic
              optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) strive to overcome the
              inherent limits of resolution of the modern light microscope.
              These techniques, however, are not always feasible or optimal for
              live cell imaging. Thus, in this review, we explore three
              techniques for extracting high resolution data from images
              acquired on a widefield microscope-deconvolution, model
              convolution, and Gaussian fitting. Deconvolution is a powerful
              tool for restoring a blurred image using knowledge of the point
              spread function (PSF) describing the blurring of light by the
              microscope, although care must be taken to ensure accuracy of
              subsequent quantitative analysis. The process of model
              convolution also requires knowledge of the PSF to blur a
              simulated image which can then be compared to the experimentally
              acquired data to reach conclusions regarding its geometry and
              fluorophore distribution. Gaussian fitting is the basis for point
              localization microscopy, and can also be applied to tracking spot
              motion over time or measuring spot shape and size. All together,
              these three methods serve as powerful tools for high-resolution
              imaging using widefield microscopy.",

  abstract = "Digital imaging has provided scientists with new opportunities to
              acquire and manipulate data using techniques that were difficult
              or impossible to employ in the past. Because digital images are
              easier to manipulate than film images, new problems have emerged.
              One growing concern in the scientific community is that digital
              images are not being handled with sufficient care. The problem is
              twofold: (1) the very small, yet troubling, number of intentional
              falsifications that have been identified, and (2) the more common
              unintentional, inappropriate manipulation of images for
              publication. Journals and professional societies have begun to
              address the issue with specific digital imaging guidelines.
              Unfortunately, the guidelines provided often do not come with
              instructions to explain their importance. Thus they deal with
              what should or should not be done, but not the associated 'why'
              that is required for understanding the rules. This article
              proposes 12 guidelines for scientific digital image manipulation
              and discusses the technical reasons behind these guidelines.
              These guidelines can be incorporated into lab meetings and
              graduate student training in order to provoke discussion and
              begin to bring an end to the culture of ``data beautification''.",

              many other green fluorescent and photoactivatable proteins. Here
              we tested all vitamins of commonly used media (such as Dulbecco's

              an imaging medium, which ensures high photostability of GFPs at
              the expense of minimal biochemical disturbance. Then, we tested

               have become standard techniques for the modern cell biologist
               because they can form the basis of an increasing number of
               assays for molecular function in a cellular context. There are
               two major types of de-convolution approaches---deblurring and
               restoration algorithms. Deblurring algorithms remove blur but
               treat a series of optical sections as individual two-dimensional
               entities and therefore sometimes mishandle blurred light.
               Restoration algorithms determine an object that, when convolved
               with the point-spread function of the microscope, could produce
               the image data. The advantages and disadvantages of these
               methods are discussed in this chapter. Image de-convolution in
               fluorescence microscopy has usually been applied to
               high-resolution imaging to improve contrast and thus detect
               small, dim objects that might otherwise be obscured. Their
               proper use demands some consideration of the imaging hardware,
               the acquisition process, fundamental aspects of photon
               detection, and image processing. This can prove daunting for
               some cell biologists, but the power of these techniques has been
               proven many times in the works cited in the chapter and

              microscopy images, including optimizing sample preparation for
              fixed and live cells, choosing the most suitable microscope for a
              given application and configuring the microscope parameters.
              Suggestions are offered for planning unbiased and rigorous
              confocal microscope experiments. Common pitfalls such as
              photobleaching and cross-talk are addressed, as well as several
              troubling instrumentation problems that may prevent the
              acquisition of quantitative data. Finally, guidelines for
              analyzing and presenting confocal images in a way that maintains
              the quantitative nature of the data are presented, and
              statistical analysis is discussed. A visual summary of this

  abstract = "One of the challenges in modern fluorescence microscopy is to
              reconcile the conventional utilization of microscopes as
              exploratory instruments with their emerging and rapidly expanding
              role as a quantitative tools. The contribution of microscopy to
              observational biology will remain enormous owing to the
              improvements in acquisition speed, imaging depth, resolution and
              biocompatibility of modern imaging instruments. However, the use
              of fluorescence microscopy to facilitate the quantitative
              measurements necessary to challenge hypotheses is a relatively
              recent concept, made possible by advanced optics, functional
              imaging probes and rapidly increasing computational power. We
              argue here that to fully leverage the rapidly evolving
              application of microscopes in hypothesis-driven biology, we not
              only need to ensure that images are acquired quantitatively but
              must also re-evaluate how microscopy-based experiments are
              designed. In this Opinion, we present a reverse logic that guides
              the design of quantitative fluorescence microscopy experiments.
              This unique approach starts from identifying the results that
              would quantitatively inform the hypothesis and map the process
              backward to microscope selection. This ensures that the
              quantitative aspects of testing the hypothesis remain the central

              the light microscope will deliver an image however badly it is

              the foundations of both electron and light microscopy for
              biologists and life scientists working with the mouse. An
              explanation is given of how an image is formed. A description is

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Biomedical scientists need to access figures to
              validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel
              research hypotheses. However, figures are difficult to comprehend
              without associated text (e.g., figure legend and other reference
              text). We are developing automated systems to extract the
              relevant explanatory information along with figures extracted
              from full text articles. Such systems could be very useful in
              improving figure retrieval and in reducing the workload of
              biomedical scientists, who otherwise have to retrieve and read
              the entire full-text journal article to determine which figures
              are relevant to their research. As a crucial step, we studied the
              importance of associated text in biomedical figure comprehension.
              METHODS: Twenty subjects evaluated three figure-text
              combinations: figure+legend, figure+legend+title+abstract, and
              figure+full-text. Using a Likert scale, each subject scored each
              figure+text according to the extent to which the subject thought
              he/she understood the meaning of the figure and the confidence in
              providing the assigned score. Additionally, each subject entered
              a free text summary for each figure-text. We identified missing
              information using indicator words present within the text
              summaries. Both the Likert scores and the missing information
              were statistically analyzed for differences among the figure-text
              types. We also evaluated the quality of text summaries with the
              text-summarization evaluation method the ROUGE score. RESULTS:
              Our results showed statistically significant differences in
              figure comprehension when varying levels of text were provided.
              When the full-text article is not available, presenting just the
              figure+legend left biomedical researchers lacking 39-68\% of the
              information about a figure as compared to having complete figure
              comprehension; adding the title and abstract improved the
              situation, but still left biomedical researchers missing 30\% of
              the information. When the full-text article is available, figure
              comprehension increased to 86-97\%; this indicates that
              researchers felt that only 3-14\% of the necessary information
              for full figure comprehension was missing when full text was
              available to them. Clearly there is information in the abstract
              and in the full text that biomedical scientists deem important
              for understanding the figures that appear in full-text biomedical
              articles. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the texts that appear in
              full-text biomedical articles are useful for understanding the
              meaning of a figure, and an effective figure-mining system needs
              to unlock the information beyond figure legend. Our work provides
              important guidance to the figure mining systems that extract
              information only from figure and figure legend.",

              This knowledge is a decisive factor in biological research and

              several computational object tracking methods, software system

              together different disciplines and branches of technologies.
              Object tracking is the process of locating and monitoring
              specific object and its behavior in sequential images. In this
              paper, a comprehensive review on object tracking stages and

              works out of the box for end users, through a simple and
              intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and
              adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time,
              3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants.
              TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that
              aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of
              TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily
              customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an
              extensible platform where developers can easily write their own
              detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms
              within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework

              current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of
              three different biological problems. First, we perform
              Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how
              light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early
              development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the
              lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we
              investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-$\kappa$B essential
              modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the
              cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in
              the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse
              motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for

              demonstrated increased extracellular matrix remodeling in vitro
              compared to Cav1 deficient (Cav1KO) pMEFs, similar to the
              original study (Goetz et al., 2011). In vivo, we found higher
              levels of intratumoral stroma remodeling, determined by
              fibronectin fiber orientation, in tumors from cancer cells
              co-injected with Cav1WT pMEFs compared to cancer cells only or
              cancer cells plus Cav1KO pMEFs, which were in the same direction
              as the original study (Supplemental Figure S7C; Goetz et al.,
              2011), but not statistically significant. Primary tumor growth
              was similar between conditions, like the original study
              (Supplemental Figure S7Ca; Goetz et al., 2011). We found
              metastatic burden was similar between Cav1WT and Cav1KO pMEFs,
              while the original study found increased metastases with Cav1WT
              (Figure 7C; Goetz et al., 2011); however, the duration of our in
              vivo experiments (45 days) were much shorter than in the study by
              Goetz et al. (2011) (75 days). This makes it difficult to

              that the cells required more time to manifest the difference
              between treatments observed by Goetz et al. We also found a
              statistically significant negative correlation of intratumoral
              remodeling with metastatic burden, while the original study found
              a statistically significant positive correlation (Figure 7Cd;
              Goetz et al., 2011), but again there were differences between the
              studies in terms of the duration of the metastasis studies and
              the imaging approaches that could have impacted the outcomes.

Moreover, in an attempt to market competing systems, the microscopes have often been inappropriately described as easy to use and suitable for near-beginners. Insufficient understanding of the experimental manipulations and equipment set-up leads to the introduction of errors during image acquisition. In this feature, I review some of the most common practical pitfalls faced by researchers during image acquisition, and how they can affect the interpretation of the experimental data. This article is targeted neither to the microscopy gurus who push forward the frontiers of imaging technology nor to my imaging specialist colleagues who may wince at the overly simplistic comments and lack of detail. Instead, this is for beginners who gulp with alarm when they hear the word “confocal pinhole” or sigh as they watch their cells fade and die in front of their very eyes time and time again at the microscope.

However, photo-sensitive molecules inside cells and in standard cell culture media generate toxic by-products that interfere with cellular functions and cell viability when exposed to light. Here we show that primary cells from the rat central nervous system respond differently to photo-toxicity, in that astrocytes and microglia undergo morphological changes, while in developing neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) it induces cellular death. To prevent photo-toxicity and to allow for long-term photo-stimulation without causing cellular damage, we formulated new photo-inert media called MEMO and NEUMO, and an antioxidant rich and serum free supplement called SOS. These new media reduced the detrimental effects caused by light and allowed cells to endure up to twenty times more light exposure without adverse effects, thus bypassing the optical constraints previously limiting experiments.},

The protocol includes steps to examine feature-driving differences between samples and to visualize correlations between features and treatments to create interpretable heatmaps using the open-source web tool Morpheus. In the second protocol, we show how to interactively explore images together with the numerical data, and we provide scripts to create visualizations of representative single cells and image sites to understand how changes in features are reflected in the images.

               method to a quantitative one. However, as biologists are
               adopting quantitative bioimaging and these experiments become
               more complex, researchers need additional expertise to carry out
               this work in a rigorous and reproducible manner. This Essay
               provides a navigational guide for experimental biologists to aid
               understanding of quantitative bioimaging from sample preparation
               through to image acquisition, image analysis, and data
               interpretation. We discuss the interconnectedness of these
               steps, and for each, we provide general recommendations, key
               questions to consider, and links to high-quality open-access
               resources for further learning. This synthesis of information
               will empower biologists to plan and execute rigorous
               quantitative bioimaging experiments efficiently.",

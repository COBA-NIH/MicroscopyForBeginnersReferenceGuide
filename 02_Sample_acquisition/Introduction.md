# Introduction

Microscopes are optical instruments, and as such, they are composed of different optical components and devices. As a beginner, it is important to recognize the experimental parameters that can affect the quality and rigor of the imaging data, and by extension, its interpretation. 

A foundational concept is the “light path,” which can be used to trace out light’s trajectory from the light source to the detector. When working with microscopes, whether it is a cell culture microscope or a cutting-edge superresolution system, it is important to take the time to trace out the different light paths in the system. By approaching the system as a sum of its parts means that optimizing and troubleshooting become systematic processes compared to when the system is treated as a black box. This [interactive tutorial at MicroscopyU](https://www.microscopyu.com/tutorials/tepaths) shows the light paths in a standard inverted microscope; [this view](https://www.microscopyu.com/microscopy-basics/components) gives more detail about the various parts.

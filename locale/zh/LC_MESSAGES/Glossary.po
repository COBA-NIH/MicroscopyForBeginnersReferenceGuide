msgid ""
"Fluorescence imaging of the whole thickness of a piece of tissue is very "

"inhomogeneities in refractive indexes within the tissue itself, resulting in"
" poor light penetration. Additionally, light coming from different parts of "
"the sample contribute to fluorescence blur, drastically reducing contrast "
"and resolution in any given plane. As a result, researchers tend to use "
"tissue sectioning techniques to extract information about cellular "
"components and their spatial distribution or relationships from a thin two-"
"dimensional volume. However, most components in any complex biological "
"system such as an organ are not contained within this two-dimensional "
"volume, and therefore, this approach compromises the understanding of the "
"spatial relationships among cellular components. Tissue clearing focused on "
"reducing the inhomogeneities in the tissue by equilibrating the refractive "
"index throughout the sample. This allows light to pass through the tissue "
"and therefore enables high resolution, volumetric imaging of whole organs "
"and tissues using conventional microscopy techniques such as confocal "
"microscopy without the need to physically section the sample."
msgstr ""
"由于组织内部折射率的不均匀性会导致光吸收和散射，从而造成光穿透力差，因此对整个组织厚度进行荧光成像极具挑战性。此外，来自样本不同部分的光线也会造成荧光模糊，显著降低任何给定平面上的对比度和分辨率。因此，研究人员通常采用组织切片技术，从二维薄片中提取细胞成分及其空间分布或相互关系的信息。然而，任何复杂生物系统（例如器官）中的大多数成分并不包含在这个二维体积内，因此，这种方法会影响对细胞成分之间空间关系的理解。组织透明化技术旨在通过平衡整个样本的折射率来减少组织内部的不均匀性。这使得光线能够穿过组织，从而可以使用共聚焦显微镜等传统显微镜技术对整个器官和组织进行高分辨率的体积成像，而无需对样本进行物理切片。"

"There are many different options for types of samples to image, and advances"

"**My sample is too opaque** - Thicker specimens, like thick tissue sections,"
" pigmented cells, or whole organisms can be challenging to image due to "

"{term}`refractive index` within the tissue itself, resulting in poor light "

"tissues into slices of different thicknesses. This process is called tissue "

"frozen in tissue freezing medium and later cut into thin slices by a machine"
" like a cryostat, microtome, or vibratome and sections collected into a tube"

"**我的样本太不透明** - "

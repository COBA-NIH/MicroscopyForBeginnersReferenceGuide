"For example, you could classify cells based on a visual phenotype and train "
"a machine learning classifier to derive which measurement ranges are "
"associated with different classes. This is supervised classification because"
" a person is providing instruction of how many classes there should be and "
"examples of what each class should look like for the computer to learn from."

"**Machines are lazy** Machine learning classifiers aren’t necessarily going "
"to learn the biologically relevant features that distinguish objects from "

"of your classifier and lead to incorrect conclusions. For instance, if "
"clinicians often put rulers next to malignant looking moles and not next to "
"benign moles and try to train a machine learning classifier to distinguish "
"malignant vs. benign, the model might learn to classify images with rulers "
"as malignant without tapping into any of the relevant features of the moles."

"{cite}`Narla2018-qh`. If possible, examining which features your model is "

"**机器也有惰性** "
"机器学习分类器未必能学习到区分不同类别物体的生物学相关特征。混淆特征，即那些随表型变化但与表型本身没有生物学关联的特征，会限制分类器的效用，并导致错误的结论。例如，如果临床医生经常在看起来像恶性的痣旁边放置尺子，而不是在良性痣旁边放置尺子，并试图训练一个机器学习分类器来区分恶性和良性痣，那么模型可能会学习将带有尺子的图像分类为恶性，而忽略了痣的任何相关特征。这是一个[真实案例](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30244720/)"
" "
"{cite}`Narla2018-qh`。如果可能，检查模型用于对象分类的特征是检查此问题的一种方法。此外，标准化不同类别对象的图像采集方式，并包含足够大的、具有丰富变化的图像训练集也至关重要。例如，您肯定不希望所有阳性细胞都来自三月份拍摄的样本，而所有阴性细胞都来自一月份拍摄的样本。"

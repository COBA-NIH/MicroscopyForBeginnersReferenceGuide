"**Widefield**, sometimes called _epifluorescence_, microscopes that take in "
"all the light available to them in a single light path; this approach "
"requires the least complex hardware, and also is often advantageous when "
"imaging dim samples. {term}`Deconvolution` is sometimes performed after "

#: ../../02_Sample_acquisition/Introduction.md:11
msgid ""
"**Confocal** - microscopes that remove out-of-focus light in the light path,"
" typically using one or many pinholes to physically block this light. "
"Several variants of confocal microscopy exist; spinning-disk confocal "
"microscopes are often preferred for live-cell imaging applications as they "
"tend to minimize toxicity to the sample."
msgstr ""
"**共聚焦显微镜**——一种能够消除光路中离焦光线的显微镜，通常使用一个或多个针孔来物理阻挡这些光线。共聚焦显微镜有多种变体；转盘式共聚焦显微镜因其能最大程度地减少对样本的毒性，常用于活细胞成像应用。"

#: ../../02_Sample_acquisition/Introduction.md:12
msgid ""
"**Multiphoton** microscopes utilize multiple pulses of longer-wavelength "
"(lower energy) light to penetrate deep into tissue, since tissues are less "
"likely to scatter these wavelengths; once there, multiple low-engergy "
"photons hitting the fluorphore at the same time will use their combined "
"energy to activate a fluorophore that each photon alone would be too weak to"
" do. Because the benefit of these systems is in their deeper penetration, "
"they are often used for performing live-animal imaging."
msgstr ""
"多光子显微镜利用多束长波长（低能量）光脉冲穿透组织深处，因为组织对这些波长的光散射能力较弱；一旦穿透到组织内部，多个低能量光子同时照射到荧光团上，它们会利用自身的能量激活荧光团，而单个光子的能量不足以激活该荧光团。由于这些系统的优势在于其更深的穿透深度，因此它们常用于活体动物成像。"

"**Superresolution** microscopes that are designed to allows the user to "
"bypass the minimum optical resolution limit (typically 200 nm, depending on "

"**Light sheet** microscopes that illuminate the sample perpendicular to the "
"axis of imaging, often by a second, orthogonal set of objective lenses. This"

"more considerations around sample mounting. Many variations on light sheet "
"microscopes have emerged in recent years."
msgstr ""
"**光片显微镜**通过垂直于成像轴的方向照射样品，通常使用第二组正交物镜。这种显微镜可以对大体积样品进行薄层光学切片，但也对样品安装提出了更多要求。近年来，光片显微镜衍生出了许多不同的型号。"

"While microscopy was by necessity a qualitative science for most of its "
"history, we now live in an era where microscope images can be used to "
"precisely quantify observable phenotypes."

"The ability to draw accurate quantitative answers from these experiments "
"relies on certain best practices being followed. If one can confidently say "
"\"Yes\" to each of the following 4 questions, one is likely to be able to "
"quantify their sample."
msgstr "从这些实验中得出准确的定量答案取决于是否遵循某些最佳实践。如果能够自信地对以下四个问题都回答“是”，那么就很有可能能够对其样本进行量化。"

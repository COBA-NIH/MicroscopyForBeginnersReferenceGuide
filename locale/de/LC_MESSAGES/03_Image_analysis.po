msgid ""
"In **supervised classification**, a human also provides information on "
"what the different groups of objects should look like by providing "
"representative examples of each group in a training dataset. The computer"
" then learns how to assign objects to groups based on their measurements "
"by testing models against the ground truth training dataset."

msgid ""
"For example, you could classify cells based on a visual phenotype and "
"train a machine learning classifier to derive which measurement ranges "
"are associated with different classes. This is supervised classification "
"because a person is providing instruction of how many classes there "
"should be and examples of what each class should look like for the "
"computer to learn from. An example of this could be annotating a subset "
"of cells that are in different stages of mitosis and training a "
"classifier to use your labels to find other cells in those stages."

"For example, you could measure hundreds or thousands of features of cells"
" from many treatments, as is typical in large-scale cell profiling "
"experiments. Next you could let the computer cluster the cells into some "
"number of different groups based on having similar measurements. This is "
"a form of unsupervised clustering, where you observe what groups emerge "
"from a computer considering their measurements only, and not class labels"
" we impose as researchers. These sorts of clustering experiments can "
"provide novel results but may also be harder to interpret; see this "

"**Machines are lazy** Machine learning classifiers aren‚Äôt necessarily "
"going to learn the biologically relevant features that distinguish "
"objects from distinct groups. Confounding features, or features that vary"
" with your phenotype but are not biologically related to it, can limit "
"the usefulness of your classifier and lead to incorrect conclusions. For "
"instance, if clinicians often put rulers next to malignant looking moles "
"and not next to benign moles and try to train a machine learning "
"classifier to distinguish malignant vs. benign, the model might learn to "
"classify images with rulers as malignant without tapping into any of the "
"relevant features of the moles. This is a [real "
"example](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30244720/) {cite}`Narla2018-qh`."
" If possible, examining which features your model is relying on to "
"classify objects can be a way to check for this. It‚Äôs also important to "
"standardize how you capture images of your different classes of objects "
"and include a large enough training set with images with lots of "

"Colocalization is when two or more different labels (e.g., eGFP and "

"**Bleedthrough** Sometimes signal from one fluorescent channel bleeds "

"This happens most commonly with fluorophores that are similar in spectra "

"weakly excited by light used to excite a different fluorophore and the "

"Intensity refers to the brightness of signal for a fluorescent label. "
"Using intensity measurements, we can infer a relative amount of "
"fluorophore or stain. So for instance, if you have a protein tagged with "
"a fluorophore, you can measure the intensity of that fluorophore to get a"
" relative measure of how much protein is present in your sample. "
"Intensity measurements include the following (non-exhaustive) and can be "
"measured within an image, in a object like a cell, in subregions of an "

"Intensity is relatively straightforward to measure, but can be quite "

"want to measure on either raw images, or illumination-corrected images, "
"but in general with minimal {term}`image processing`. Illumination-"
"correction is a form of {term}`image processing` to compensate for the "
"uneven pattern of illumination produced by most light sources where the "
"middle of the field of illumination is brighter than the edges. Then "

"Tracking, or _object tracking_, refers to the ability to estimate the "
"location of objects in motion from one frame of video to the next. "
"Practically, object tracking in microscopy involves identifying your "
"objects in each frame of your video, then relating objects from frame to "
"frame to be able to identify the same cell as it moves in space."
msgstr ""

#: ../../03_Image_analysis/Tracking.md:10
msgid ""
"There are several options for tracking objects, like the "
"[TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) {cite}`Tinevez2017-fb`"
" plugin in Fiji, but tracking is somewhat more complex to setup than the "
"previous analyses. In addition to just identifying objects in the "
"movie/time series, tracking also allows you to identify splitting (e.g. "
"mitosis) and merging events. There are many measurements that come out of"
" tracking, including spatial measures like where the objects move to, "
"speed measurements, distance traveled (length of track), and rate of "
"splitting events (e.g., mitotic events) and merging events."
msgstr ""

#: ../../03_Image_analysis/Tracking.md:15
msgid ""
"**Poor {term}`segmentation`** If objects are dropping out from frame to "
"frame, this makes it more difficult to track them over time. Accurate "
"{term}`segmentation` is the foundation of good tracking results. This can"
" become more difficult if your objects are also changing in shape or "
"intensity (due to things such as bleaching) over the course of the video."
" It‚Äôs important to find a {term}`segmentation` strategy that can work "
"well across your frames."
msgstr ""

#: ../../03_Image_analysis/Tracking.md:16
msgid ""
"**Inadequate frame rate** If objects are highly dynamic but the images "
"were not taken at a high frequency, tracking can be difficult because "
"objects might have moved too much for the algorithm to relate them from "
"one frame to the next. It is important to match the image acquisition "
"frequency to how dynamic your cells or objects are."

"Let's say you've opened your image in {term}`Fiji` and you want to "

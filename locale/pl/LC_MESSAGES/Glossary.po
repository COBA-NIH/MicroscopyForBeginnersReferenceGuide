"During the immunostaining procedure, it is important to minimize "
"nonspecific binding of the primary or secondary antibodies. In most "
"cases, this is achieved by blocking, which typically involves adding "
"substances such as normal sera, gelatin, or albumin before immunostaining"
" in order to \"occupy\" all the non-specific binding sites in the sample."

"Fixation of a specimen refers to the stabilization of the "

"stopping any biological function in that sample. The fixative used (e.g.,"
" paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, methanol), concentration and "
"conditions (e.g., buffer, temperature) determine the extent of "
"preservation of the cellular and/or molecular structures within a sample,"

"Immunolabeling is one of the most common labeling techniques for fixed "
"samples. You can use fluorescently conjugated primary antibodies to "
"detect the protein of interest or a two-step labeling with a primary "
"antibody and a fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody. Primary-"
"secondary labeling tends to result in signal amplification. The main "
"issue with immunolabeling is the size of the antibodies, which require "
"extensive permeabilization. Another good option is to use nano-bodies, "
"which only have the heavy-chain and are significantly smaller than "
"regular antibodies."

msgstr ""

#: ../../Glossary.md:29
msgid ""
"It refers to the imaging of cellular structures or biological processes "
"inside a live animal in real time, without extracting the organs or "
"fixing the sample. In general, it requires specific instrumentation or "
"modalities with improved light penetration, such as multiphoton "
"microscopy and is limited to the ability to access the specific organ, "
"often through optical windows. Intravital imaging is overseen by "
"bioethical committees and needs to be approved by IACUC and/or other "
"institutional committees."

msgid "Mounting media"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Glossary.md:32
msgid ""
"Is the solution in which your specimen is placed in (mounted). Its "
"purpose is to preserve the sample, including the fluorophores in it,  and"
" enhance the imaging quality during acquisition, by buffering the pH, "
"matching the refractive index throughout the sample (ideally matching it "
"to that of glass) and minimizing photobleaching (depending on the "
"medium). Mounting media prevents the sample from drying out allowing "
"long-term storage."

msgid "Oxygen scavengers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Glossary.md:38
msgid ""
"Oxygen tends to induce photobleaching of organic dyes and other "
"fluorophores. Addition of oxygen scavengers to the imaging media such as "
"glucose oxidase or pyranose 2-oxidase can significantly reduce "
"photobleaching of the fluorophores present in the sample. It is important"
" to understand that the use of oxygen scavengers may affect live cell "
"imaging, as these scavengers can affect the ATP and oxygen levels within "
"the sample, compromising its health and therefore biological function."

msgstr ""

#: ../../Glossary.md:41
msgid ""
"In order for the antibodies used during immunostaining or other "
"fluorophores to penetrate and bind to their antigen within a cell or "
"tissue, the membrane integrity (holes) needs to be challenged with a mild"
" detergent. The permeabilization step needs to be carefully optimized "
"depending on the antigen of interest, as it can result in a loss of "
"cytoplasm or a degradation of the signal."

"It's a measure of how light travels through a specific medium. It is an "

"Ideally, a mismatch in refractive index between the sample (mounting "
"medium), the coverslip and immersion media should be minimized in order "

msgid "Tissue clearing"
msgstr ""

#: ../../Glossary.md:59
msgid ""
"Fluorescence imaging of the whole thickness of a piece of tissue is very "
"challenging due to light absorption and scattering induced by the "
"inhomogeneities in refractive indexes within the tissue itself, resulting"
" in poor light penetration. Additionally, light coming from different "
"parts of the sample contribute to fluorescence blur, drastically reducing"
" contrast and resolution in any given plane. As a result, researchers "
"tend to use tissue sectioning techniques to extract information about "
"cellular components and their spatial distribution or relationships from "
"a thin two-dimensional volume. However, most components in any complex "
"biological system such as an organ are not contained within this two-"
"dimensional volume, and therefore, this approach compromises the "
"understanding of the spatial relationships among cellular components. "
"Tissue clearing focused on reducing the inhomogeneities in the tissue by "
"equilibrating the refractive index throughout the sample. This allows "
"light to pass through the tissue and therefore enables high resolution, "
"volumetric imaging of whole organs and tissues using conventional "
"microscopy techniques such as confocal microscopy without the need to "
"physically section the sample."

msgstr ""

#: ../../Glossary.md:62
msgid ""
"Light penetration and fluorescence imaging is negatively impacted by "
"light scattering within a thick specimen. This scattering is due to the "
"different refractive indexes present within a tissue. To facilitate "
"imaging of tissues, researchers often cut thick tissues into slices of "
"different thicknesses. This process is called tissue sectioning. In most "
"cases the samples are fixed and embedded in paraffin or frozen in tissue "
"freezing medium and later cut into thin slices by a machine like a "
"cryostat, microtome, or vibratome and sections collected into a tube or "
"onto a slide."

"The most traditional dimensionality reduction techniques is principal "
"component analysis (PCA). In a nutshell, PCA recovers a linear "
"transformation of the input data into a new coordinate system (the "
"principal components) that concentrates variation into its first axes. "
"This is achieved relying on classical linear algebra, by computing an "
"eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of the data. As a result, the"
" first 2 or 3 principal components provide a low-dimensional version of "
"the data distribution that is faithful to the variance that was "
"originally present. More advanced dimensionality reduction methods that "
"are popular in biology include t-distributed stochastic neighbor "
"embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection "
"(UMAP). In contrast to PCA, these methods are non-linear and can "
"therefore exploit more complex relationships between features when "
"building the lower-dimensional representation. This however comes at a "
"cost: both t-SNE and UMAP are stochastic, meaning that the results they "
"produce are highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters and can "
"differ across different runs."

"Although reducing dimensionality can be very useful for data exploration "
"and analysis, it may also wipe information or structure that is relevant "
"to the problem being studied. The best way to minimize this risk is to "
"carefully check any underlying assumptions of the method being used, and "
"ensure that they hold for the considered data. Dimensionality reduction "
"may also enhance and reveal patterns that are not biologically relevant, "
"due to noise or systematic artifacts in the original data (see Batch "
"effect correction section below). In addition to applying normalization "
"and batch correction to the data prior to reducing dimensionality, some "
"dimensionality reduction methods also offer so-called regularization "
"strategies to mitigate this. In the end, any pattern identified in "
"dimension-reduced data should be considered while keeping in mind the "
"biological context of the data in order to interpret the results "
"appropriately."

"Batch effects are systematic variations across samples correlated with "

"mitigated prior to making comparisons across several datasets as they "

" address this by identifying and quantifying sources of technical "

"Two of the most used methods for batch effect correction are ComBat and "
"Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA), depending on whether the sources of "

"three steps: 1) dividing the data into known batches, 2) estimating batch"
" effect by fitting a linear model that includes the batch as a covariatem"
" and 3) adjusting the data by removing the estimated effect of the batch "
"from each data point. In contrast, SVA aims at identifying \"surrogate "
"variables\" that capture unknown sources of variability in the data. The "
"surrogate variables can be estimated relying on linear algebra methods "
"(such as singular value decomposition) or through a Bayesian factor "
"analysis model. SVA has been demonstrated to reduce unobserved sources of"

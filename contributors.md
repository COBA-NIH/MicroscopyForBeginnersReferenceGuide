## How can I become a contributor?

Please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/broadinstitute/MicroscopyForBeginnersReferenceGuide/issues) or pull request to contribute! We hope for this to be a living document reflecting the best practices and resources available.

We currently also offer a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWQbemviI2OkvVkeTKUOozAzKNndcZpXIB_nE0qFMl72lqvQ/viewform) for contributions, though note these may be responded to more slowly than direct contributions to the GitHub repository.

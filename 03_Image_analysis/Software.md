# Open source software

## Introduction

When it comes time to select a software program for your image analysis, there are many options, some more general and others highly specialized to specific image modalities or types of experiments. In general, a good place to start exploring is by examining papers in your field and seeing what others have used to analyze similar experiments to your own. It‚Äôs important to note that there isn‚Äôt one correct answer to "Which program should I use?" Depending on your biological question, your images, and your own comfort with coding, there are many options available. 

Below, we summarize the use-cases and limitations of some of the most common, free and open-source software for image analysis, this is a small list and more extensive ones exist like the [A Hitchhiker's guide through the bio-image analysis software universe](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1873-3468.14451) and the [BioImage Informatics Index](bii.eu). 

Whatever software you choose, be sure to include a detailed description of your analysis in your methods, with pipeline or workflow files if possible, so others can reproduce your work. Also be sure to cite the analysis software you use! This helps developers of the software get grant funding and helps others find useful tools.

## General use software

(content/imagej)=
### ImageJ

[ImageJ](https://imagej.net/) is an imaging processing program that is capable of operating on a variety of images including multichannel, 3D and time series. It provides a variety of basic imaging processing operations, but it can be complemented with a variety of plugins for more complex tasks.


#### What are its disadvantages?



* Imaging processing operations are done one at a time, while it has the capability of batch processing and creating macros it does require some understanding of coding.
* But while it can open large images, there is a size limit to the size it can handle based on the available memory. And even if it can open large images it can slow down performance.


#### How to download/install and learn more?

To download ImageJ or its ‚Äúbatteries-included‚Äù distribution Fiji go to



* üåê [ImageJ download](https://imagej.net/downloads)

* üåê [ImageJ basics](https://imagej.net/learn/)

(content/cellprofiler)=
### CellProfiler

[CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) is a software designed for biologist by biologist, it creates a bridge between image analysis and scientist with no need of computational expertise. It was designed with the idea of an image analysis pipeline in mind, it allows you to take a series of interoperable modules to design your own custom analysis pipeline that can be applied to one or thousands of images, making it suitable for high throughput image analysis. 


#### What are its disadvantages?



* CellProfiler can‚Äôt handle large images, like whole tissue sections from histology experiments. The image size is currently limited by the available memory on your computer.
* While CellProfiler can perform analysis on 3D images the visualization is limited to a one z-plane at a time via a slider on the viewing window.
* Also several features of CellProfiler are only available for 2D images.

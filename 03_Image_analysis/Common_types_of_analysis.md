# Common types of analysis

In this section,  we detail information and tips about some common, very useful types of image analysis. We first describe two aspects of morphological analysis. **Morphology** is the study of the appearance, form, and structure of an object and morphological measurements include those based on object **shape** (e.g. cell area) as well as **intensity** (e.g. mean brightness of GFP). After describing shape-based and intensity-based analyses, we also present tips for measuring **colocalization**, **tracking objects**, and **classifying objects**.
